To run the code, you must have NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn installed. If you do not have these installations, you can get them by opening terminal and running the following commands with pip:
1)	pip install numpy
2)	pip install pandas
3)	pip install scikit-learn 

To run the code for each algorithm, simply type the following in your terminal:
			python demo.py
			python demo2.py

Demo is about the GoT dataset. Demo2 is about the Ghost,Ghouls and Goblins dataset. Each demo has each of the 5 main algorithms implemented and will print an accuracy score for each algorithm. You may uncomment plots by removing the ‘#’ before each line and rerun the code to see plots in the analysis.
