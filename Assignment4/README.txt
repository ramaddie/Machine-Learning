The raw data obtained from each experiment can be found in RLSimulation.xlsx.

To run RL_Sim, go to the folder and type in your terminal 
'java -jar rl_sim.jar'
This will open up the GUI.

For part 1, load value iteration, load the maze, adjust PJOG and run. Similar actions can be performed for policy iteration, and Q-learning.

The mazes used in the paper are found in the maze folder with filenamesâ€¦
Small maze = '0_small.maze'
Small maze with 90 wall penalty = '1_small90.maze'
Big maze = '8_big.maze'

Thank you!
